# Smart Resize GNOME extension
A gnome shell extension for automatically resizing a window that is too large for the current screen. Great for when you have a vertical monitor 
and don't want to resize windows to fit the width everytime you move something to it. Simply drag a window onto the screen you want it on and if 
it is too large it will snap to fit the width/height of the window (any dimension that is too large will be adjusted). 

You may wish to avoid this plugin if you use applications that need to span multiple screens. This plugin will stop windows from being able to be resized larger than the screen resolution.
